Displace is a menu bar application that automatically rotates your screen based on accelerometer data.  

Although Displace is compatible with SMS (SMCMotionSensor/Sudden Motion Sensor) compatible Macs, it was made with newer Hackintosh laptops/2-in-1s/tablets in mind.

###### If you have an accelerometer enabled Toshiba device you should check out [TOSMotionSensor](https://github.com/jslegendre/TOSMotionSensor), an accelerometer driver and SMS emulator for Toshiba devices.

## Status
This is the very first release of Displace and is considered to be a **beta version**. More features are on the way as well as a cleaner UI. 

## Requirements
As mentioned before, this is a beta release.  I built tested Displace on High Sierra and Mojave and everything worked as expected.  You are welcome (encouraged, really!) to try it on earlier versions but I cannot say for certain how well it will work. 


## Want to Help?

That's awesome! Here are a few ways you can:

- Development. Check out the source, there are a few comments about ideas and ToDo's.
 - Biggest one is blocking keyboard input on 2-in-1s when all the way flipped over
 - Next is some new menu bar icons. Really any icon. If you have an eye for design feel free to toss me some ideas/mockups (in the Issues section) for the UI too.
- Testing. Let me know what does and, more importantly, what doesn't work. 
- Financially. Yeeeeessshh, okay, this is where I get uncomfortable. This and other projects take time and something I've come to learn since having a child is that time isn't free. Especially (and ironically) free time. The only thing I have up right now is a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jslegendre) account if you are interested. \*cue Sarah McLachlan* Even $1/month is a huge help and allows me to dedicate more time to Hackintosh and Hackintosh adjacent projects.
